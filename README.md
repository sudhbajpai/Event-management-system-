# Simplify : Event Management System

# 1.1 Project Overview :

"Simplify” is a Mobile Application which is Designed to Help the College Student
Clubs to manage and promote their events easily and manage all the activities and tasks
of the clubs in an easy way without the use of paper.

This Application project is not only useful for the college student clubs but also for any
community, society, NGO, or organization. With the help of Simplify Application,
managing any community or organization will become easier.

Event management is the application of project management to the creation and
development of large or small scale events such as festivals, conferences, ceremonies,
formal parties, concerts, or conventions. The last few years have seen a rapid growth in
the event management industry. Considering the existing system problems related to
event management we are developing an android application for event management. 

This application will be accessible only for android. Application will mainly focus on birthday
party, marriage functions and social events. The application will be developed using
Android studio and back end will be managed in firebase database. Application will have
easy and feasible GUI for all type of users. User needs to Login at the initial phase, set
his/her profile details including location, choices, email-id, etc. User can modify or
change His/her profile at any stage. The core phase of the application will display list of
events based on the user profile details.

# 1.2 Problem Statement :

- The College Event Communities face so many challenges to promote their events in the
college and if the event is intra-college level then it becomes a more challenging
task for them.
- Maintaining the data of the Participants is also a challenging task for the student
club members they do all the tasks manually. The student clubs create excel sheets
for maintaining participants records since they do this task manually therefore
sometimes there was chance of missing any participant’s data.
- Maintaining records of previous events is also difficult for the college student
clubs. Since there is no any particular platform for maintaining the previous
records of events this becomes a challenging task for student clubs.
-Sometimes the certificate distribution can also not be easy, sometimes the club
members don’t have the proper details of participants and therefore some students
are not getting their certificates.
